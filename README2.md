A note to the developer:

You can stop this at any time.

But since you're gonna keep going for a bit, here's a couple tips:
	1. Don't get stuck on style.
		This is what you do every time: You get stuck on trying to make a visual idea work, and you just end up
		making a complicated mess of everything, filling up multiple components with unecessary styles and containers,
		endlessly tweaking on border sizes and drop-shadow and running in cirlces until you realize what you're doing,
		take a couple steps back, and then cut out all the garbage you threw in. Don't let yourself get stuck! Not on
		*style,* an definitely not on styling so *early.*
	2. Continuing the previous idea: stay a medium distance away from your code. In fact, you're probably almost always
		better off taking a big step back than you are leaning in closer.
	3. Clean up your mess. Test your models. Abstract your API access. Decouple your components.
	4. Thoroughly document code that you don't plan on changing.
	5. Write skeleton code for planning/developing new features.
	6. Robust and intelligent error checking. The colr.org api is full of broken data.  You know at some point you're
	   going to recieve a 20bit color string. Figure out what to do about that before it happens, and you get stuck on
		 tracking down another breaking bug that has nothing to do with what you were working on.
	7. Or just go to bed. Or go smoke some weed. Or take a bath. Or just stand with your eyes closed. Take a break from
	   screens and mental models of digital models of other models of things that aren't real and you can't actually touch.
		 You are good at manipulating those types of arbitrary symbols, but go hiking. Get dirty. Scrape yourself up trying
		 to climb the rocks at Papago Park. Get a sunburn. Make your body be sore.
	8. Or just sit here twirling in your chair waiting for the sprint challenge to unlock. :)
