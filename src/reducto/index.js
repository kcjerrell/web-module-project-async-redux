// So I need to be specific about what this project is going to do so I can design the state
// And what it is going to do is
// ... let you create/edit/customize color schemes
// and browse top/random schemes from colour lovers
// using color names and info from colour lovers api

// and as a stretch goal (or maybe this should just be my primary goal?):
// create icon sets sourced from the noun project

// I dunno, but I'm into colors lately, so that's what I'm gonna start with

// since combining multiple reducers makes a compound state object, I'm going to lead with
// that shape in mind, so I can add new things as I progress

// perhaps scheme and theme should be distinct.....
// scheme is just a set of colors
// theme probably includes that (based on material design) would include
// primaryColor + shades + onPrimary
// secondaryColor + shades + onSecondary
// backround + onBackground
// surface + onSurface
// error + onError

// getting too complicated. perhaps I'll start by just making a component that loads a random
// scheme from colour lovers

// Not to be used for initialState, just an example of the expected app state shape
